How to import WiRE data into Matlab
-----------------------------------

The files in this folder allow data stored in Renishaw's WiRE WDF format
to be imported into Matlab.  If you want to access data stored in the
older WXD format, we recommend converting these files to WDF format first
by using the converter built in to WiRE.

We recommend that you copy these Maltab .m files to a new folder on your
computer, and then add that folder to the Matlab path (see the ADDPATH
command in Matlab for further details).  The folder should contain the
following files:
 * WdfReader.m
 * WdfError.m
 * WiREDataType.m
 * WiREDataUnit.m
 * WiREMeasurementType.m
 * WiREScanBasicType.m
 * WiREScanType.m

In Matlab, you can then type "help WdfReader" to read detailed information
about how to use the WdfReader class.

WdfReader.m is the main file used to access WDF data from Matlab; the other
files provide custom enumerations or datatypes that support WdfReader, and
will rarely need to be used directly.
